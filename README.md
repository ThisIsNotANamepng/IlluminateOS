# IlluminateOS
This is a rudimentary os-type thing. It has preinstalled apps created by me. Most of them are privacy-security related, as that's what I'm into and what I have the most experience coding, but I will totally add other apps that other people write. 

Until I create a file and permission system, I won't be adding an official option to add apps. Enjoy!

2. PGP generation, encryption, and decryption

3. Verified boot on start of OS (Attestation)

4. Encrypted (AES-256) and unencrypted notes

5. Google Search

6. Simple Calculator

7. Hashing machine

8. File checksum machine

## Methodology

I have looked at many os-type projects, and I've noticed that it's often hard to understand what commands are the correct syntax. That's why I only use letter commands.
